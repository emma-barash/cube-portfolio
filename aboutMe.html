            <p>Ayamé (アヤメ) means "iris" in Japanese.  I was born in a small town called Ukiah, two hours north of San Francisco, California.
            My whole life I have ridden horses, hiked the Sierras, and developed a profound interest in performance cars.  After my senior year, I 
            moved to Newport Beach to attend a night class in car design and work for my cousin's sucessful startup company.  In January of 2018, 
            I began my first semester at Brandeis University, where I quickly became involved in the academics, the robotics club, and the equestian 
            club.  This was my first formal exposure to computer science, for which I took a profound interest.
