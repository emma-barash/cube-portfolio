            <h1>Emma Ayamé Barash</h1>
            <p>Ayamé (アヤメ) means "iris" in Japanese.</p>
            <p>I was born in a small town called Ukiah, two hours north of San Francisco, California.
            All my life, I have ridden horses, backpacked for weeks at a time in the high Sierras, and developed a deep interest in motorcycles 
            and performance cars.  After my senior year, I moved to Newport Beach, California, to attend a night class in car design and to work at my cousin's 
            successful startup company.  In January of 2018, I began my first semester at Brandeis University, where I quickly became involved in 
            academics, as well as the robotics club and the equestrian club.  In college, I had my first formal exposure to computer science for which I 
            took a profound interest.  My second year, I enrolled in an introductory course for programming in Java and though I enjoyed the material, 
            I felt lost in the class, which consisted of a sea of over one hundred individuals. </p>
            
           <p>In order to pursue practical usage of coding, I have taken a sabbatical from Brandeis to attend an intensive web development program. 
            This past May, I graduated and received a certificate in full stack web development from V School, located in Salt Lake City.
